Bing Aerial Imagery Analyzer for OpenStreetMap
===========================================================================
This web page shows the default bing satellite and aerial photos overlaid with
their capture date as set in the HTTP headers for each tile. It uses a PHP proxy
script located here[1] to create the transparent date overlay tiles.
If zoomed in past zoom level 11, the page shows an approximation of the 
remaining zoom depth for each quarter tile. This is visualized using a 
semi-transparent color (greener is more remaining zoom depth) and a number.

If you want old-style overlay tiles, not showing remaining zoom depth beyond 
zoomlevel 11, use 'nodepth=1' in the query string.

There is probably some violation of the Bing terms of use, as I call the http
headers for the tiles directly, bypassing the Bing API. I see no real way around
this, but if this site stops working all of a sudden, you know why. As of 
version 0.8, the load on the server is reduced somewhat by disk-caching the 
overlay tiles when they are generated.

Installation
===========================================================================
1. Edit index.html. Change the values for bingCredentials and baseURL. If
You don't have a Bing Maps API key, get one through 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642.aspx
2. Edit tile.php. Change thhe value for $TC_BASE to a web-accessible
directory. Optionally, enable logging to a specific file by setting 
$LOCAL_LOG 
3. Create directories 'tiles' and 'tiles_simple' in the directory you 
provided in $TC_BASE, and make them writable for the webserver.
4. Go to [baseURL]/bingimageanalyzer - should work now!
