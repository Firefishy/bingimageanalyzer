Bing Aerial Imagery Analyzer for OpenStreetMap
===========================================================================
This web application is a fork of mvexel's Bing Aerial Imagery Analyzer for 
OpenStreetMap [1]. It shows the Bing satellite and aerial photos overlaid with 
red/green coloured tiles indicating availability of high resolution imagery. 
If zoomed in to zoom level 14 or more, the page checks whether the requested 
tiles contain hires imagery and paints them green if they do and red if they 
do not. This is visualized in a mosaic kind of way when you zoom out to lower 
zoom levels.

There is probably some violation of the Bing terms of use, as I call the http
headers for the tiles directly, bypassing the Bing API. I see no real way around
this, but if this site stops working all of a sudden, you know why. As of 
version 0.8, the load on the server is reduced somewhat by disk-caching the 
overlay tiles when they are generated.

You don't have a Bing Maps API key, get one through 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642.aspx
2. Edit tile.php. Change thhe value for $TC_BASE to a web-accessible
directory. Optionally, enable logging to a specific file by setting 
$LOCAL_LOG 
3. Create directory 'hires' in the directory you provided in $TC_BASE, 
and make them writable for the webserver.
4. Go to [baseURL]/bingimageanalyzer - should work now!
